OS:
Linux Mint 20.2 Cinnamon
g++ (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0

How to compile:
Just open the folder which montador.cpp is and use the following line on a terminal.
"g++ montador.cpp -o montador"
Of course, you can include optimizations.

How to run:
The file with the right extension (.asm for -p, .pre for -m, .mcr for -o) and executable (montador) have to be at the same folder. Then, use:
"./montador -op file" (without the extension).
