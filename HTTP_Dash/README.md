A implementation of DASH over HTTP adaptative protocol (SARA - Segment Aware Rate Adapatation Algorithm) using Python language. Developed over the pydash framework. <br/>
The implementation consists only of the r2anewalgorithm1.py file, the rest can be found at the base code and are just examples.<br/><br/>
